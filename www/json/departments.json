In close contact with emergency physicians and nurses in the Emergency Department, our paramedics and EMTs in essence bring the Emergency Department to the patient in the “field,” providing advanced monitoring, medical care and interventions, saving valuable minutes.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art Emergency Department features modern lifesaving technology and is staffed by board-certified physicians and experienced nurses with advanced skills. This high-level of emergency medical care is enhanced by the compassionate care for which Francisco's Hospital is widely noted for providing to patients and families.\r\n\r\nFor the most critically ill and injured patients, Francisco's Hospital offers a Level II Trauma Center accredited by the American College of Surgeons. This Center is staffed around-the-clock by trauma specialists, including trauma surgeons and emergency physicians.\r\n\r\nFor patients experiencing a stroke, Francisco's Hospital is certified as a Stroke Center. There is a critical pathway for ensuring the rapid evaluation of these patients and the timely and appropriate treatment to minimize long-term consequences.\r\n\r\nFor patients experiencing an acute heart attack, Francisco's Hospital is certified as a Primary Angioplasty Center. Once identified as a candidate either by EMS or by the emergency physician, a critical pathway ensures the rapid evaluation of the patient and movement to the Cardiac Cath Lab for definitive care to minimize long-term consequences.\r\n\r\nEmergency, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is available for patients suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning, diver’s “bends” and other conditions through our Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine Center.\r\n\r\nIf needed, it’s comforting to know that Francisco's Hospital’s Critical Care Unit has been nationally recognized for the exemplary level of care provided. The Unit’s nurses have been awarded the Beacon Award for Critical Care Excellence by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses three times, the only hospital in Fairfield County to receive this prestigious national award three times.\r\n\"",

    "description": "\"Achievement. Technology. Education.\r\n\r\nThe Digestive Disease Center at Francisco's Hospital offers state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of digestive diseases and conditions. We’ve been nationally recognized by Healthgrades, Inc., a company trusted by millions to measure health care quality; U.S. News & World Report ranked us in the top 7 for gastroenterology services in Connecticut; and we’ve received American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Quality Endoscopy Unit recognition three years in a row. Our expertise has earned commendation, and we’re honored to lend that expertise to the residents of Fairfield County and beyond.\r\n\r\nOur widely recognized, fellowship-trained physicians provide leading-edge diagnostics and treatments for disorders affecting the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas and liver. The conditions we evaluate and treat include acid reflux/heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colon cancer, Barrett’s esophagus and hepatitis C.\r\n\r\nWe’re the only endoscopy center in Fairfield County and one of the only centers in Connecticut to offer Third Eye Retroscope-enhanced colonoscopy, which uses Third Eye technology to increase the detection of potentially precancerous polyps by up to 23 percent.\r\n\r\nAt the Digestive Disease Center, our expertise is supported by achievement, state-of-the-art technology and education. We serve as a major teaching site for the Yale School of Medicine. William Hale, MD, Director of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, and Dennis Meighan, DO, Director of Endoscopy, help train residents and fellows, and conduct clinical research studies designed to improve patient care.\"",

    "description": "\"Expert Care for the Mind, Body and Spirit.\r\n\r\nHow one feels emotionally is just as important as how one feels physically. That’s why, along with standard medical treatments, Francisco's Hospital offers an Integrative Medicine Program for patients in the hospital as well as for individuals on an outpatient basis.\r\n\r\nThis progressive program provides proven, scientifically-based, holistic therapies to help support conventional medical treatments and to promote healing, relaxation and overall well-being. Integrative medicine therapies have also been shown to effectively help relieve medical treatment side effects.\r\n\r\nOur program is overseen by a steering committee consisting of physicians, nurses and administrators. The only approved treatment modalities are those that are evidence-based. Our providers are credentialed and processed in the same manner as our medical staff team, all of whom require current licensing, certification, liability insurance and background check.\r\n\r\nWhat you should KNOW:\r\n\r\nFocused on caring for the mind, body and spirit, therapies and expert consultations are personalized for each individual and performed by licensed and certified practitioners.\r\n\r\nOur inpatients can request to receive Integrative Medicine therapies or counseling bedside. Outpatient sessions are held in a quiet, comfortable treatment room located within the Hospital’s Integrative Medicine Center.\r\n\r\nThe Integrative Medicine Program’s medical director is internal medicine and hospitalist Kesav Nair, MD.\r\n\r\nLinda Versea, APRN, director of cancer services at Francisco's Hospital, is the program’s administrative manager.\r\n\r\nDownload a PDF of Francisco's Hospital’s Integrative Medicine Booklet 2013, which includes therapy and consultation and descriptions.\r\n\r\nAll services are provided by appointment, Monday through Friday.

    "description": "Acupuncture helps promote a healthy recovery from surgery, offers relief from pain, nausea and discomfort, reduces stress, helps to enhance the immune system, and restores the natural flow of the body’s own energy. Employed over centuries for health and maintenance, acupuncture provides a sense of balance and equilibrium between the mind and the body. In essence, acupuncture guides the body towards homeostasis, where healing takes place on a deep level in a natural and organic manner. \r\n\r\nDuring acupuncture, very fine needles are inserted into specific points along meridian pathways that traverse the body and correspond with the proper functioning of the organs, musculoskeletal structure and internal physiological systems. Pain and disease are mirrored through the meridians of the body. When they are properly aligned and restored to their original functioning, the result is a better balance between mind and body. Acupuncture’s popularity continues to grow and become more accepted into the mainstream as clinical studies are regularly proving its effectiveness, and people are experiencing positive results.\r\n\r\nPrivate Sessions and Community Sessions - Our program offers private one-hour sessions or community acupuncture. In community sessions, patients are treated in a quiet and relaxing group setting. These treatments are just as effective and more affordable than private sessions. If you are new to acupuncture, we do require a private consultation to ensure that community acupuncture is right for you. You can then alternate between community sessions with private sessions if you wish.\r\n",

From mobility and activities of daily living, to feeding and swallowing, as well as management of bladder, bowel and cognitive functions, no part of patient rehabilitation is overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe treatment team will develop an individualized plan of care, together with the patient and patient’s family, and then meet weekly to update and modify the plan as needed. The team also assists patients with discharge planning, including recommendations for home modifications and assistive equipment, if necessary. Our rehabilitation team will work closely with you to establish personal goals, so you can return to your desired lifestyle.\r\n\r\nImportantly, in keeping with our comprehensive approach, the rehabilitation program will also make sure that every patient’s goals and progress are passed on to the next set of clinicians to ensure a smooth transition to the next level of care after discharge.\r\n\r\nRehabilitation includes:\r\nTherapy services—generally three hours a day, five days a week\r\nA comprehensive team evaluation held weekly to discuss your progress\r\nPatient/family meeting with your rehabilitation doctor to discuss your plan of care\r\nEducational opportunities for your family members/caregivers to participate in your rehabilitation and learn more about your care needs\r\nAssistance in planning for what you will need upon discharge from the rehabilitation unit\"",

Our physicians have academic affiliations with major university hospitals in New York and Connecticut and, when necessary, work closely with those hospitals to coordinate the care of our patients.\r\n\r\nTo ensure your treatment meets the highest standards, our weekly cancer-specific multidisciplinary tumor boards bring cancer surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists and other physicians together to discuss the optimal management of your care.\r\n\r\nThe WCC is home to the offices of our medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, cancer geneticist and cancer center support team (patient navigators, oncology nurse clinicians, social workers and family therapists). The WCC contains our chemotherapy infusion suite and radiation therapy equipment, so that cancer treatments are coordinated and conveniently located under one roof.\"",
